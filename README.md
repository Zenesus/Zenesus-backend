## What is it?

It handles the webscraping, data collection and many more complicated tasks for the app to display!

## TODO
- Scrape grades asynchronously - make sure you can scrape all semester grades
- Allow the users to see avaliable report cards
- Allows the changing of users for accounts that can preview two or more users
- Find some way to communicate with front end
